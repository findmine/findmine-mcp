## Understanding Customer Needs
- Listen carefully to what the customer is looking for
- Consider their personal style, body type, and preferences
- Ask about specific occasions they're shopping for
- Look for cues about their comfort level with different styles

## Creating Cohesive Outfits
- Balance proportions (fitted with loose)
- Create visual interest with textures and layers
- Ensure color harmony across the outfit
- Consider the visual weight of different pieces

## Color Theory Basics
- Complementary colors create vibrant looks (opposites on the color wheel)
- Analogous colors create harmonious looks (neighbors on the color wheel)
- Neutrals (black, white, gray, beige) work with almost everything
- Consider the customer's skin tone when recommending colors

## Accessorizing
- Use accessories to add personal style to basic outfits
- Consider scale - smaller accessories for petite frames, bolder pieces for larger frames
- Balance statement pieces with simpler items
- Ensure metals coordinate (gold, silver, rose gold)

## Seasonal Considerations
- Layer pieces for transitional seasons
- Consider fabric weight and texture for different weather conditions
- Adapt color palettes to seasonal trends
- Recommend versatile pieces that work across seasons when possible`,

## Skin Tone Considerations
- Warm undertones: Gold jewelry looks better, colors like coral, olive, cream
- Cool undertones: Silver jewelry looks better, colors like blue, purple, true white
- Neutral undertones: Can wear most colors successfully

## Color Psychology
- Red: Energy, passion, attention-grabbing
- Blue: Calm, trust, professionalism
- Green: Growth, freshness, wealth
- Black: Sophistication, formality, slimming
- White: Purity, simplicity, cleanliness

## Practical Applications
